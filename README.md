## MATLAB implementation of low illumination image enhancement for night time pedestrian detection based on a hyperbolic tangent curve and BM3D (block matching and 3d filerting)
The implementation is based on 2 journal papers [1], [2]. First, low lighting image is enhanced by HTC [1], then the denoising technique - BM3D is applied to alliviate noise introduced after brightness enhancement.
